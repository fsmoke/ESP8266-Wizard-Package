/* !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is a wrapper to the xtav60-specific header lives in the
xtav60-specific include area. The recommended way to find the header is to
add the board-specific location to your -I include path for compilation.
Alternatively "#include <xtensa/xtav60/xtensa/xtav60.h>" like below.

This wrapper explicitly includes it for convenience in builds (without
an explicit board package) that use board support internal to an Xtensa
core package, and where an explicit -I is not used. It is provided
because xt-xcc currently has no concept of board and does not search the
board-specific include area.  In the future this wrapper might disappear.
