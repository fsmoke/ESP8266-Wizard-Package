xthifi2-aic.h       Part of board-support-package for XT-HiFi2 board.

Interface (API) to driver for Texas Instruments TLV320AIC31 Audio Codec.
This API could move toward a generic API for different audio DAC devices.

Currently it is associated with a specific board and assumes a single AIC 
device and 2 channels (stereo), and allocates 4x4KB buffers in local DRAM
(that consumes the entire 16 KB local DRAM on the the XT-HiFi2's core).
If the buffer space needs to be larger, it must be placed in system RAM
(currently the driver source must be changed and the driver recompiled -
 later the API needs to allow the application to provide the buffers).

The audio format is PCM with each sample being a signed 32-bit integer,
big-endian, with successive samples alternating left and right. Note that
the XT-HiFi2 board has a little-endian processor.
