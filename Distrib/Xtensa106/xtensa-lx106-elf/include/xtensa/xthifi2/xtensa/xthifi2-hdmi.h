xthifi2-hdmi.h       Part of board-support-package for XT-HiFi2 board.

Interface (API) to driver for Analog Devices AD9889B High Definition 
Multimedia Interface (HDMI) transmitter.

This API could move toward a generic API for different HDMI devices.

Currently it is associated with a specific board and assumes a single HDMI 
device configurable as 2,4,6 or 8 audio channels. It and allocates 4x4KB 
buffers in local DRAM (that consumes the entire 16 KB local DRAM on the 
the XT-HiFi2's core).Later the API needs to allow the application to provide 
the buffers.

The audio format is PCM with each sample being a signed 32-bit integer,
big-endian, with samples in interleaved format. Note that the XT-HiFi2 board 
has a little-endian processor.
