uart-16550-board.h  Board-specific UART info on the XT-HiFi2 board.

Interface between board-independent driver and board-specific header.

This is used by a board-independent 16550 UART driver to obtain board-specific
information about 1 instance of the 16550 UART on the board, such as the device
register base address and spacing (a function of how the address lines are 
connected on the board) and the frequency of the UART clock. The driver does
not refer directly to the board-specific header, which therefore is not 
constrained to use macro names consistent with other boards.

!! Must not contain any board-specific macro names (only UART specific). !!

Included at compile-time via an include path specific to the board.

The XT-HiFi2 board contains two 16550 UARTs and uses a dedicated UART clock.
